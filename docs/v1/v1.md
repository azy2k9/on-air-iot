This diagram shows how we can use some form of webhook or cron job to readFromSlack, outlook and teams and determine the status of whether i am in a meeting or in a call, after determining this I can then make an API call to a SONOFF switch to turn the power on / off, which will in turn will power on / off the connected "On Air" sign. I have also included a manual trigger for this in the form of an API Gateway endpoint so that it can easily be triggered from a slack command
